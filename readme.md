This is a cookbook manager program. The current version runs on the command line.
The purpose of this project was to show my knowlege in OOP concepts, Basic file I/O, and basic program formatting.
I used encapsulation to keep variables from being directly accessed. The ArrayList is also used quite often to store data.
StringBuilder is used to create an string output that is simular to what is seen in a cookbook.
File I/O is used as both a way to save/retrieve cookbooks to/from a folder located on user's desktop.
File I/O is also used to export a .txt file of the recipe so the user can share it with friends/family.
