This is a cookbook manager program. The current version runs on the command line.
The purpose of this project was to show my knowledge of OOP concepts, Basic file I/O, and basic program formatting.
I used encapsulation to keep variables from being directly accessed. The ArrayList is also used quite often to store data.
StringBuilder is used to create a string output that is similar to what is seen in a cookbook.
File I/O is used as a way to save/retrieve cookbooks to/from a folder located on the user's desktop.
File I/O is also used to export a .txt file of the recipe so the user can share it with friends/family.
